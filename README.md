# What is that tool ?
This tool was made for do-ers who are ready to invest time and effort on an higher goal. 
I believe that knowing at a glance the efforts you put on something can really make the difference for achievement. 

- You will be able to see what you did this day and every other day, month and life easily.
- Set your own life objectives and start labeling and tracking time. 

# How does it work ?
- You can track your work time and label it.
- First you enter a category of work and start the chronometer, and when you are done, you stop it.

- Then you can find your cumulated times for the day.
- This is what has the most value to me especially when you choose the right labels and do not split to much.

- You can also add an entry for the past time has all your goals are not in front of a computer.

# What you could do with that ? 
- Decide that you are going to work 100h on your arts skill this month and track it. 
- Decide that you are going to do sport for 30 min per day and track it.
- Get to know where you actually put your time while working.
- Track your time has a freelancer or on a task for work that you bill hourly.
